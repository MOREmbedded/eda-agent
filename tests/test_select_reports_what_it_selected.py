"""obj_select reports matched and selected, never another request's notes.

Gen_SelectObjects handed back the modify reply, whose tail is the property
notes, and never reset them. An obj_modify with a property this build does
not write, followed by an unrelated obj_select, answered with the earlier
call's property name and success false. A select on 3D bodies after a
query of their X and Y said X and Y were unreadable, although the
selection had worked.
