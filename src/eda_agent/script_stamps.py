"""Per-unit stamps that say which build of each script unit Altium runs.

Altium keeps compiled script units between runs. Re-running
StartMCPServer does not recompile an edited unit, and a unit that failed
to compile can keep serving its previous image while SCRIPT_VERSION in
Main.pas reads new. So one version constant cannot say whether the code
on disk is the code running.

Each unit ends with ``Function UnitStamp_<unit>(Dummy : Integer)`` returning
``'dev'`` in the repository. ``install-scripts`` writes a hash of the
unit's content in its place in the deployed copy, the script reports
every stamp through ``application.get_unit_stamps``, and ``app_ping``
recomputes them from the files and names any unit that differs.
